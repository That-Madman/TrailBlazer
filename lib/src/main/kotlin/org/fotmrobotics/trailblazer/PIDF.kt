/**
 * A PID class originally written for fun, it was well proven for use during the 2023-2024 season
 * of FTC. It uses the traditional PID controller model, with the addition of a feedforward value,
 * which is a common addition for more complex control. For more advanced control, it allows for
 * functions or lambdas to also be passed, allowing for a more streamlined control for later use or
 * overriding certain aspects of the code if used in an abnormal environment
 * @param kP the P value
 * @param kI the value for the magnitude of change in the [I][i] value
 * @param kD the D value
 * @param kF the F value
 * @param posGet the function to get the current value of what is being influenced
 * @param exFun the function executed when pidCalc is called
 * @param timeGet the function to get the time
 * @property update calculates the PID value and executes exFun if given
 * @property pidCalc same as [update][update], with the addition that it calculates the error for
 * you, allowing you to utilize the [position function][posGet].
 * @property resetI resets the [I][i] value that gets accrued as the program runs
